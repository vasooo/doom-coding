# Doom Coding Best Practices
- Track your progress: End sessions by asking Claude to update CLAUDE.md with where you left off
- Preview websites: Go to your desired directory and start an HTTP server<br>
```
  python -m http.server 3005
```
  then visit http://your-machine.tailnet-name.ts.net:3005 in a browser on your phone<br>
  *Wherever you would use localhost:PORT to view an application, replace localhost with your-machine.tailnet-name.ts.net*
- View Databases: Use the PostgreSQL app to troubleshoot databases on the go<br>

# Happy Doom Coding!

Too much screen time is probably a bad thing - but working code is for sure better than brain rot
