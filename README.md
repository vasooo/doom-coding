# doom-coding
A DIY approach to coding on-the-go!

As an aspiring builder, I sought out a way to keep coding while not at home. Thanks to some Claude-assisted research and troubleshooting, I can now code from my phone anywhere at anytime via "Doom Coding" (think *Doom Scrolling* but more productive).

After this 5-minute setup guide, you'll be able to "doom code" anywhere you have Internet connection.

Code in the air!<br>

Code on a run! <br>

Even code at the club! <br>

I still get giddy getting so much done while being so far away from home. In Taiwan, I could access my computer in Philadelphia and built an MVP in my downtime. 

*Shameless plug: check out www.friendlyr.ai to help shape the future of connection!*

Make sure to "Watch" this repo for future updates to this doom coding guide. As I tryout the latest mobile coding tools (e.g. Claude Code on the Web), I'll update this repository with comparisons.

Happy doom coding my friends!

# What You Need
1. A Computer running 24/7 with Internet Connection
2. A Smartphone
3. A Claude Pro subscription

# Overview
Use Tailscale, Termius, Claude Code, and a computer running 24/7 to continue building anywhere you have Internet connection.

# Getting Started

## 1. Set Up Your Computer
- Disable sleep in power settings<br>

  https://tailscale.com/download
- Install Claude Code on your computer<br>
https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview

## 2. Set Up Your Phone
- Install Tailscale → Sign in with the same account<br>
  https://tailscale.com/download
- Install Termius (A Mobile Terminal Tool) <br>
  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/termius-modern-ssh-client/id549039908
- Note the MagicDNS address of your computer (e.g., my-computer.tailnet-name.ts.net)<br>

- Create a new host in Termius:<br>
  * Label: What you want your connection to be called
  * Hostname: The MagicDNS address (my-computer.tailnet-name.ts.net)
  * Port: 22
  * Username/Password: Your login for your computer <br>

## 3. Connect and Code
- Turn on Tailscale VPN on your phone<br>
  <img width="400" height="245" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03646788-619b-427e-8e47-5bf8219c1c36" />
- Select your host in Termius<br>

- Run `claude` and start coding <br>

# Troubleshooting
- If you're not able to establish a connection from your phone via Termius to your computer:
## 1. Reset your Tailscale VPN
- Check your phone settings to make sure you are connected to the Tailscale VPN. <br>
<img width="400" height="227" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b041eff-9001-4e41-8922-c7f3bcb368da" /> <br>
- Check the Tailscale app to make sure the Tailscale VPN is on. If your phone and doom coding computer do not have a green circle next to their labels, there is an issue with your Tailscale/Internet connection.

## 2. Make sure your computer is ON and UNLOCKED
When disconnecting/reconnecting power, make sure you unlock the computer. I've ran into this issue one too many times.

# Best Practices
### Track your progress:
End sessions by asking Claude to update CLAUDE.md with where you left off.

### Preview websites:
Go to your desired directory and start an HTTP server<br>
``
  python -m http.server 3005
``
then visit http://your-machine.tailnet-name.ts.net:3005/your-html-file.html in a browser on your phone<br>

*Wherever you would use localhost:PORT to view an application, replace localhost with the machines MagicDNS from the Tailscale app (e.g. your-machine.tailnet-name.ts.net)*

### View Databases:
Use the PostgreSQL app to view databases for your projects https://apps.apple.com/us/app/postgresql-client/id1233662353

### Bookmark Useful Sites:
On your computer, bookmark the sites you refer to during development (e.g. Google OAuth, GitHub) to make it easier to reference from your phone. I use the Chrome app to seamlessly access the sites I need. 


# Happy Doom Coding!
Please contibute your best practices! I am looking forward to hearing all the places you will code!
